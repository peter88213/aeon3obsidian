For more information, see the [project homepage](https://peter88213.github.io/aeon3obsidian) with description and download instructions.


## Important

Please note that this script has not yet been extensively tested. To me, it's actually just a proof of concept. I probably won't develop the script further. Feel free to copy the project and modify it to your own liking.
